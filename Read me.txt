This MatLab software is designed to view images and movie-sequences that are stored in various file formats and allows management of a collection of image data. In addition, it supports correction of drift of captured movie-sequences and allows tracking of cell movement.

To start your analysis add the path containing these files and then simply type "PMMovieLibraryManager" into the command line. This will launch the project viewer and you will have access to all the classes contained in this folder.
